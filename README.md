# Iris-Species
The Iris species aims to classify the species of Iris flowers based on their features using machine learning algorithms.


The Iris flower dataset is a well-known dataset in the field of machine learning and statistics. It contains 150 observations of iris flowers, with four features recorded for each observation: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The objective is to classify the iris species (Setosa, Versicolour, or Virginica) based on these features.

The ultimate goal of this project is to build a robust classification model that can accurately classify the species of Iris flowers based on the available features.

**Features Used**
  **sepal_length:** Sepal length in cm
  **sepal_width:** Sepal width in cm
  **petal_length:** Petal length in cm
  **petal_width:** Petal width in cm
  **species:** Target variable (Setosa, Versicolour, Virginica)

  
**Machine Learning Models Used**
  To achieve the best possible prediction accuracy, the following machine learning models and techniques were used:
    **Random Forest Classifier:** An ensemble learning method for classification.
    **Label Encoding:** To encode the target variable into numerical format.
    **Train-test Split:** To split the dataset into training and testing sets for model evaluation.

    
**Implementation**
  Tools and Libraries
    **Python:** The programming language used for implementation
    **PyCharm:** The IDE used for development
    **Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis
    **NumPy:** For numerical operations
    **Scikit-learn:** For building and evaluating machine learning models
    **Matplotlib and Seaborn:** For data visualization

    
**Steps** to implement this firstly start with 
  **Data Loading and Exploration:** Load the dataset and perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the data. Next, 
  **Data Preprocessing:** Encode the target variable and check for missing values. Thirdly, 
  **Model Building:** Train a Random Forest Classifier and evaluate its performance and then 
  **Model Evaluation:** Use metrics such as accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix to evaluate model performance. Finally
  **Feature Importance:** Identify the most important features for predicting the iris species.

  
**Results**
    The Random Forest Classifier achieved an accuracy of XX% on the test set.
    The classification report provides precision, recall, and F1-score for each class.
    The confusion matrix helps visualize the performance of the classification model.
    Feature Importances
    The Random Forest model was used to identify the most important features for predicting iris species. The feature importances are visualized in a bar plot.

**Conclusion**
  This project successfully demonstrates the process of building and evaluating a machine learning model for classification tasks using the Iris flower dataset. The achieved accuracy indicates that the model can classify the species of Iris flowers with a high degree of confidence.

**Assumptions**
  No missing values were present in the dataset.
  The target variable 'species' was encoded using label encoding.
